DigitalOcean is a cloud hosting provider that offers virtual Linux servers called “droplets” with SSH access and solid-state drives. They have datacenters around the world and their web hosting plans are ideal for developers.

### Is DigitalOcean the Perfect Host for Your Website?

DigitalOcean provides cloud servers that developers can use to quickly create new virtual machines for their projects. They allow you to fully control your web hosting environment at the same time that you pay for only the resources you use.

The real beauty of their services is that you only pay for the resources you use.

On many web hosts, you have to choose a higher tier plan just to get root access, even if you don’t need that level of resources. On DigitalOcean, you pay based on:
- RAM
- CPUs
- Disk space (all SSD)
- Bandwidth.

<p>DigitalOcean calls its virtual machines “droplets .” They have <strong>two flavors of droplets</strong>: Standard and CPU Optimized. </p>
